# Development Server

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to run the development server

# Overview

- I made this project keeping in mind for users varying from enable total beginners to advanced.
- Why just be limited to example datasets(most of the sql learning sites run examples on their own dataset),
  - so added the feature to adding owns datasets in CSV format.
  - Due to lack of backend & database (cant store it and add pictire)
  - _ToDo_ - use LocalStorage to store it.
- For beginners to learn SQL queries and commands - in the queries section I added a readonly CodeEditor where it dynamically updates the editor with the SQL queries selections made.
- Current QUERIES -
  - **SELECT** (Completed)
    - For all columns '\*'
    - On selected Columns
    - On selecting '\*' automatically deselects any other Columns
    - On selected Columns automatically deselects '\*'
  - **WHERE** (Completed)
    - When parsing CSV to json on adding CSV - Numeric datatypes are also converted to string
    - Using Regex to seperating -
      - Numeric Datatype
      - String Datatype
    - So relevant queries [IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, Comparisions] can be displayed accordingly. (TODO)
  - **ORDER BY** (Completed)
    - From the given column name, select columns to Sort the data by - ASC and DESC option
    - Using SortableJS to sort(by dragging up and down) the columns, and updating the relative order.
  - **LIMIT** (To Add)
  - **OFFSET** (To Add)
  - **GROUP BY** (To Add)
- More Queries yet to be added (including joining 2 tables)
- The application can work with large dataset (I tested till 100,000 rows of data - 1-2 sec delay in showing results)
- In the Results Page there is Toggle Editable Editor button, which allows users to update the Queries and see the different results.
- Currently I have coded the logic for SELECT query result, Others will be coded soon.

### Future Works -

- [ ] Performance increase for Huge datasets.
- [ ] Add local storage to store the imported datasets.
- [ ] Add more queries and their functionality.
- [ ] Work on Editable Editor in Result page to check query Validiation.
- [ ] Complete Dark theme styling
